# Hackathon task: Predict employee churn.

# Context
Nowadays more and more companies are focused on improving the working conditions of their employees as
well as employee work-life balance. In order to make such improvements, it is essential to
know employees better to identify what really matters to them.

Combining traditional approaches, such as surveys, with available data and machine learning algorithms one
can find better insights and improve employee satisfaction.


# Tasks
Create a model to predict accurately the employees who are going to leave the
company in the next two quarters.

Using the most important insights from the data, shape a strategic initiative to take
preventive measures and make employees happier.


# Metrics and Data
The dataset structure is sequential. The data for particular employee might change from quarter to quarter. Thus, you may
try a variety of different ML algorithms that could manage such changes and unlock insights.
